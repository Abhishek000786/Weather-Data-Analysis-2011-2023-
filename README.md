Weather Data Analysis and Insights (2011-2023)

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing weather data spanning from 2011 to 2023. The dataset captures a wide range of atmospheric conditions at different times of the day. The goal of this analysis is to identify trends, seasonal patterns, correlations, and potential outliers, providing insights into how various weather factors interact over time.


Dataset Features
The dataset includes the following weather parameters:


Date: Daily date records (in datetime format).

Temperature: Minimum and maximum temperatures, along with 9 AM and 3 PM temperature readings.

Rainfall: Daily rainfall amounts (in float format) and a categorical indicator (Yes/No) for whether it rained today.

Evaporation and Sunshine: Daily evaporation rates and total hours of sunshine.

Wind Data: Direction and speed at 9 AM and 3 PM, plus peak gust speed.

Humidity and Atmospheric Pressure: Humidity and pressure measurements at 9 AM and 3 PM.

Cloud Cover: Cloud cover recorded at 9 AM and 3 PM.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values: Missing data was addressed through imputation or removal to maintain data integrity.

Data Types: Each column was assigned appropriate data types (datetime, float, int, object) to facilitate accurate analysis.

Outlier Detection and Treatment: Outliers were detected using statistical techniques such as Z-score and IQR and handled appropriately to prevent skewed results.

Analysis and Statistics Applied
Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance) were calculated to understand the dataset's distribution.
Correlation Analysis: A correlation matrix was generated to explore relationships between weather parameters such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity.
Data Visualization: Histograms, boxplots, and other charts were used to visualize distributions, trends, and outliers.
Outlier Analysis: Statistical methods were applied to identify and mitigate outliers that could impact the results.

Tools and Libraries
The project was developed using the following tools and libraries:

Python: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
Pandas: For handling dataframes and preprocessing.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization (if used).

Tableau: For advanced visualization and dashboard creation (optional, if applicable).

Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive analysis of weather data over a 12-year period. Through data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization, we were able to gain valuable insights into temperature variations, rainfall patterns, wind behavior, and other meteorological conditions.
